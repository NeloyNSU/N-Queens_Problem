# N-Queens_Problem
Given an integer N, find a way to place N queens on an N x N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. Since a queen attacks along her row, column, and diagonals, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Your task is to write a program that takes an integer N as input and finds a solution to the N-Queens problem in the following format (example for N=4 given below â€“ Queens are marked with X):
